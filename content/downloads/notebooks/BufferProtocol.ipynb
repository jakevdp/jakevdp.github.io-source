    "The Python buffer protocol, also known in the community as [PEP 3118](http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3118/), is a framework in which Python objects can expose raw byte arrays to other Python objects. This can be extremely useful for scientific computing, where we often use packages such as [NumPy](http://numpy.org) to efficiently store and manipulate large arrays of data. Using the buffer protocol, we can let multiple objects efficiently manipulate views of the same data buffers, without having to make copies of the often large datasets.\n",

    "At first glance, this might seem rather trivial. Why is this so useful?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, in scientific computing, most of the interesting algorithms are implemented in compiled code: for example, [scipy](http://scipy.org) is essentially a set of wrappers around [NetLib](http://www.netlib.org/) utilities, which are well-tested implementations of scientific algorithms written mostly in Fortran and C. The ability for Python to natively share data with these compiled libraries is incredibly important for scientific computing. This is one big reason that NumPy and its predecessors were initially developed, and it's why the buffer protocol was later proposed and added to Python's standard library. The buffer protocol is extremely useful for what scientists do with Python: build intuitive interfaces to compiled legacy code.\n",
    "\n",
    "With apologies to the [PyPy](http://pypy.org/) project's extremely active community, I should also mention that this is one of the main reasons that scientists don't really pay much attention to it: until PyPy can easily interface to all the C and Fortran code we use on a daily basis, all its JIT-ed performance gain is of very little use to us.\n",
    "\n",
    "This cannot be emphasized enough: **it is fundamentally the Buffer Protocol and related NumPy functionality that make Python useful as a scientific computing platform.**"

   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "Fortunately, most scientists can simply use the buffer protocol via tools like NumPy without knowing too much of the details of what's behind it. Because the buffer protocol is fundamentally a C-API entity, implementing new functionality with it generally requires digging into the guts of Python's C API. For example, the code that enables the above numpy example is found in NumPy's [buffer.c](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/numpy/core/src/multiarray/buffer.c) file, and reading through it is not particularly enlightening. This is the power of Python in a nutshell: it abstracts away C-level messiness like this and instead gives us the nice, powerful, and clean Python interface we all know and love.\n",
    "\n",
    "But sometimes you need to get your hands dirty. Imagine, for instance, that you have a C object that you'd like to wrap and make available to Python.  Your first course might be to use something like [f2py](http://wiki.scipy.org/Cookbook/F2Py), [cython](http://cython.org), or [SWIG](http://www.swig.org/) to do this: I'd definitely recommend these tools for most problems of this nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "But you may, for various reasons, want to go even deeper and implement the buffer protocol directly. (For example, you may be interested in taking data structures from another language, such as Julia, and exposing them to Python in a flexible manner). Below I'll give you an example of how to do this."

The buffer protocol in Python is basically structure which defines a very flexible interface to an offset & strided multi-dimensional array.  From the [CPython source](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Include/object.h#L178-191), we can see what it looks like:\n",

We see that the array can be multi-dimensional, it can have arbitrary NumPy-style strides along each dimension, as well as arbitrary [PIL](http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/)-style suboffsets for each dimension.\n",

    "Let's take a look at the code that was added to the ``pymyarray2`` example.  It's fairly straightforward, actually: we first define a function which builds a buffer from the object:\n",

    "``` C\n",
    "/* Here is the buffer interface function */\n",
    "static int\n",
    "PyMyArray_getbuffer(PyObject *obj, Py_buffer *view, int flags)\n",
    "{\n",
    "  if (view == NULL) {\n",
    "    PyErr_SetString(PyExc_ValueError, \"NULL view in getbuffer\");\n",
    "    return -1;\n",
    "  }\n",
    "\n",
    "  PyMyArray* self = (PyMyArray*)obj;\n",
    "  view->obj = (PyObject*)self;\n",
    "  view->buf = (void*)self->arr.arr;\n",
    "  view->len = self->arr.length * sizeof(int);\n",
    "  view->readonly = 0;\n",
    "  view->itemsize = sizeof(int);\n",
    "  view->format = \"i\";  // integer\n",
    "  view->ndim = 1;\n",
    "  view->shape = &self->arr.length;  // length-1 sequence of dimensions\n",
    "  view->strides = &view->itemsize;  // for the simple case we can do this\n",

    "\n",
    "If you're used to working with multi-dimensional arrays in C, the elements of the structure should be pretty self-explanatory. Here we're using integers so we've used the ``\"i\"`` format code. The item formats are extremely flexible: you can basically use any of the codes within Python's [``struct``](https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html) module, which gives you nearly endless possibilities for passing around structured data. For more complicated arrays with multiple dimensions, you may have to allocate arrays for the shape, strides, etc. In that case, it's possible to define a ``release_buffer`` function which deallocates these arrays when the buffer is no longer needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we put this function in a ``PyBufferProcs`` structure,\n",

    "static PyBufferProcs PyMyArray_as_buffer = {\n",
    "  // this definition is only compatible with Python 3.3 and above\n",
    "  (getbufferproc)PyMyArray_getbuffer,\n",
    "  (releasebufferproc)0,  // we do not require any special release function\n",
    "};\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And then include this structure in the Python Type definition. \n",

    "This was just a simple example of defining the buffer protocol for an object in CPython. It's exactly the kind of description I *wished* I had had as I tried to figure out how this stuff worked.  I hope this is as helpful to you as it would have been to me!\n",
