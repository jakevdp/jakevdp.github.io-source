    "First, a few words on ``pip`` vs. ``conda``.\n",
    "For many users, the choice between pip and conda can be a confusing one.\n",
    "I wrote [way more than you ever want to know](https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2016/08/25/conda-myths-and-misconceptions/) about these in a post last year, but the essential difference between the two is this:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *pip* installs **python** packages in **any environment**.\n",
    "- *conda* installs **any** package in **conda environments**.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you already have a Python installation that you're using, then the choice of which to use is easy:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you installed Python using Anaconda or Miniconda, then use ``conda`` to install Python packages. If conda tells you the package you want doesn't exist, then use pip (or try [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/), which has more packages available than the default conda channel).\n",
    "  \n",
    "- If you installed Python any other way (from source, using pyenv, virtualenv, etc.), then use ``pip`` to install Python packages\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, because it often comes up, I should mention that you should **never** use ``sudo pip install``.\n",
    "\n",
    "*NEVER.*\n",
    "\n",
    "It will always lead to problems in the long term, even if it seems to solve them in the short-term.\n",
    "For example, if ``pip install`` gives you a permission error, it likely means you're trying to install/update packages in a system python, such as ``/usr/bin/python``. Doing this can have bad consequences, as often the operating system itself depends on particular versions of packages within that Python installation.\n",
    "For day-to-day Python usage, you should isolate your packages from the system Python, using either [virtual environments](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/) or [Anaconda/Miniconda](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/download.html) — I personally prefer conda for this, but I know many colleagues who prefer virtualenv."

    "Basically, in your kernel directory, you can add a script ``kernel-startup.sh`` that looks something like this (and make sure you change the permissions so that it's executable):\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "#!/usr/bin/env bash\n",

    "# activate anaconda env\n",

    "exec python -m ipykernel $@\n",

A similar approach could work for virtualenvs or other Python environments.\n",

    "After proposing some simple solutions that can be used today, I went into a detailed explanation of *why* these solutions are necessary: it comes down to the fact that in Jupyter, the kernel is disconnected from the shell.\n",
    "The kernel environment can be changed at runtime, while the shell environment is determined when the notebook is launched.\n",
    "The fact that a full explanation took so many words and touched so many concepts, I think, indicates a real usability issue for the Jupyter ecosystem, and so I proposed a few possible avenues that the community might adopt to try to streamline the experience for users.\n",
    "\n",
    "One final addendum: I have a huge amount of respect and appreciation for the developers of Jupyter, conda, pip, and related tools that form the foundations of the Python data science ecosystem.\n",
    "I'm fairly certain those developers have already considered these issues and weighed some of these potential fixes – if any of you are reading this, please feel free to comment and set me straight on anything I've overlooked!\n",
